Keygetter.py as it is now creates a program that takes keystroke input from the keyboard and translates it into
text via Morse code. with the lines 27 and 57 commented it should work with pyserial and pyserialMorse to take morse
code input from a properly setup arduino and translate it to text. I can't test that since I have no arduino.- Makhn0
